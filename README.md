# Follow-Pros

This is an app that allows you to track and follow pro athletes from your favorite college. Right now, this is built with simple HTML and JavaScript. Looking to implement BootStrap to spice up the front end a bit.


User selects a college, and the stats for pro athletes will display. Right now, this only supports NBA players from a select number of colleges. 2/24/20


Looking to expand to all Power 5 teams.

Technologies/Frameworks: Bootstrap, etc
